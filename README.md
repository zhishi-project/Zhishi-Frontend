# Zhishi
Zhishi is a Question and Answer platform for Andelans

## Why Zhishi ?

You've definitely been in this situation before:

>Someone asks you a question; Shortly after another person comes with the same question and the cycle continues like that, till you tell the next person to go ask from the last/previous person you answered.

If only there were such applications that helps you aggregate all your answers in one place, so that fellows don't keep coming to you for answers to commnon questions.

>You don't need to wish anymore, because Zhishi is here

The app itself is live on http://zhishi.andela.com/
